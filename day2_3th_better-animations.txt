#Â 3rd presentation - Better animations with famo.us

- CSS3 animations are hard

- Some stuff can't be done with only CSS: physics, etc

- famo.us:
  * own render-tree composing engine
  * more like we get in the words of 3D graphics, OpenGL, DirectX
  * could be hard but performant, unlimited...

- We can't write JS code in CSS (no Math.sin and other physics), so famo.us allows to write a sheet code
- It allows to declare JS objects with selectors CSS as keys and write some logics/transformations inside

- Future:
  * will be integrating with Angular 2 using AtScript.
  * WebGL incoming
  * Better API
