# 5rd presentation - Restangular 2.0

## Restangular 1

- R1 is doing this stuff:
```
$scope.users.getList('cars');
Calculate URL
Pre Request hooks
Call API
Parse Response > Restangularize Element
                        v
                 Extend Model Hook
                        v
                 Post response to hooks
                        v
                 Return data to the user
```

## Restangular 2

- Written in ES6
- Reorganization of files: split into models, services, extensions
- Stop monkey patching models, better inheritance
- static beforeRequest, parseResponse methods instead of interceptors
- better many to many relations declarations
- make Angular part optional: possibility to use an another lib than $q or $http (for example q and $.ajax).
