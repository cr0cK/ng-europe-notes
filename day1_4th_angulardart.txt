# 4th presentation: Angular Dart

- dartium (dev), compiles to JS
- version 1.0 (oct 10 2014)

- templates are same than AngularJS
- under the hood:
  Putting app together > Compile the HTML > Reacting to user interactions
- Putting app together
```
  Angular Module > Application (Injector) > run
  Todo Module    >
```
- app.run()
  Compiler > ViewFactory > View
- Compile HTML to ViewFactory
  * Walks the DOM
  * Store in ElementBinders
- {{}}, ng-repeat, etc. are decorators hover classes
- ng-repeat > HTML Comment > ViewPort (transclude)
- Scope digest:
```
  [t1,t2,t3] > pendingTasks > pendingTasks.length > pendingTasks.isEmpty
             > task, task, task
```
- zones (part of dart:async)
  Ported to JS to zones.js
- Zones event loop:
```
  my z = zone.fork(...);
  z.run(f);
  > execution
  > once zone done, apply()
```

## New concepts in v2
- @annotations
- Views and ViewPorts
- Zones
- per elements Injectors
